### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Currently working on ...
    - IANN
        
        This is a project I am calling Inital Algebra Neural Networks for lack of a better name. Strongly inspired by Jeremy Gibbons' [An Initial-Algebra Approach to Directed Acyclic Graphs](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2423982_An_Initial-Algebra_Approach_to_Directed_Acyclic_Graphs) and is basically applying this idea to neural networks for an inital algebra approach to neural networks. There is currently 4 repositories associated with this project.
       
       - [Fungi](https://github.com/jakeKonrad/Fungi) and [Fascia](https://github.com/jakeKonrad/Fascia)
           
           These repositories are more theory focused. Fungi is using Idris2 as it has proof relevant capacity but also has computational niceties. Fascia is using Cubical Agda for the HITs.
           
       - [Crustaciann](https://github.com/jakeKonrad/Crustaciann) and [Haskiann](https://github.com/jakeKonrad/Haskiann)

           These repositories are more practical in focus with Crustaciann being in Rust for its fine control over what the computer is doing and speed while Haskiann is in Haskell for stronger types and easier prototyping.
           
       These repositories are being developed more or less in lockstep so they can inform and guide each other as the different languages have different viewpoints on the same ideas. On a sliding scale from theoretical to practical it would go Fascia, Fungi, Haskiann and Crustaciann.
